## Background

As a developer, Vim is one of my favorite editor, but its configuration is hard to maintain.

Inspired by the [Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), I create this project as an assistant to
help me setting Vim.

## Install

__Warning:__ If you want to give these configuration a try, you should first fork this repository, review
the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my configuration unless you know what
that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git and bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Documents/code/vim-config`.)
The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version.

    $ git clone https://github.com/dantin/vim-config.git && cd vim-config
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

This is only a documentation page. You can find out more on [specification](docs/SPEC.md).
